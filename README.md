# Roulette System Repository Overview

## Introduction

This document describes a systematic betting approach designed to optimize chances of achieving a net positive outcome. The strategy revolves around committing to a predefined number of rounds, with the necessity to stop immediately upon a win to prevent losses.

## Folder Structure

The `lib` directory contains various subdirectories named `round_x`, where `x` represents the number of rounds. Each folder contains a `README.md` file that outlines simulations for the respective number of rounds, showing detailed scenarios of bets and outcomes.

### Key Components

- **Max Bet**: The highest bet allowed.
- **Round**: Indicates the current round of betting.
- **Bet**: The actual bet placed.
- **Profit - Running Loss**: Shows the net outcome as the difference between profits and losses up to that round. 
- **Running Loss**: Cumulative losses over the rounds.

It is crucial to the system's integrity that betting ceases immediately after the first win within the designated rounds. Failure to do so undermines the mathematical foundation of the strategy and can lead to significant losses.

## Probability of Loss

A critical aspect of this strategy is the calculated probability of losing everything, a measure added to each round's summary to provide a statistical basis for the risk involved. This probability indicates how likely it is to lose all rounds, helping to manage expectations and strategy adherence.

## Disclaimer

The betting strategy and the calculations provided herein are based on mathematical models and are intended for informational purposes only. Actual gambling involves risks, and this system, like any betting strategy, cannot guarantee profits. Users are advised to understand their financial and emotional capacity for risk before engaging in betting activities.

### Important Note

Each round's simulation is based on the premise that continuing to bet beyond a win is likely to negate the gains. This strategy is designed to maximize the probability of a net positive outcome by capitalizing on the first win. Thus, adherence to stopping after a win is essential for the system's effectiveness.

## Conclusion

The folder structure in `lib` provides a comprehensive view of the potential outcomes for each set number of rounds, aiding users in making informed decisions based on statistical probabilities and strategic insights.

This README provides an overview and essential guidelines to effectively utilize the provided betting system. For any further information or detailed queries, please refer to the individual README files in each `round_x` directory within the `lib` folder.
